- **File Management**: Secure storage and download of generated documents

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Database Schema Enhancements

#### New Enums:
```python
class ReportStatus(str, enum.Enum):
    DRAFT = "draft"
    GENERATED = "generated"
    SUPERVISOR_REVIEW = "supervisor_review"
    APPROVED = "approved"
    NEEDS_REVISION = "needs_revision"
    REJECTED = "rejected"

class UserRole(str, enum.Enum):
    APPLICANT = "applicant"
    EVALUATOR = "evaluator"
    SUPERVISOR = "supervisor"  # NEW
    GOVERNANCE = "governance"
    ADMIN = "admin"
```

- `word_file_path`: Location of generated Word document
- `report_data`: JSON structure with all evaluation data
- Timestamp fields for all workflow stages

**User Table Enhancements:**
- `supervisor_id`: Links evaluators to their supervisors
- Relationship mappings for supervisor-evaluator hierarchy

**Application Status Updates:**
- `EVALUATION_COMPLETED`: Evaluation finished, ready for report generation
- `REPORT_GENERATED`: Technical report has been generated
- `SUPERVISOR_REVIEW`: Report submitted for supervisor review

### Backend Architecture
